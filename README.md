# 2048-tetris

**Version**: 0.1.4

A version of Tetris that includes some ideas from the game 2048.

To play the game, download the `2048-tetris.html` and file and run it in your browser.

Here is a screenshot of a quick play-through:

To work on down the road:

 - Rewrite code from scratch
 - Improve UI and UX
 - Perfect how the 2048 mechanics work and come up with unique ideas
 - Adjust the values of spawned shapes nicely to add more interesting gameplay
 - Adjust scoring system
