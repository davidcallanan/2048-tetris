This is just a proof of concept, put together very quickly. It has not been extensively tested, and the core features could have significant flaws.

To play the game, download the `2048-tetris.html` and file and run it in your browser.

Here is a screenshot of a quick play-through:

To work on down the road:

 - Rewrite code from scratch
 - Improve UI and UX
 - Perfect how the 2048 mechanics work and come up with unique ideas
 - Adjust the values of spawned shapes nicely to add more interesting gameplay
 - Adjust scoring system
